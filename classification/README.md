## About The Project

This project implements three classification algorithms for multiple data sets in Python. <br>
Before all a categorizer is implemented in order to substitute numeric attributes with appropriate categories.  <br>

## Decision Tree

In `decision_tree.py`, a decision tree is implemented in order to predict a person's income (category) from their other attributes. <br>
The data set is available in `Dataset/Dataset1.csv`.<br>
Gini and entropy criteria are implemented.<br>
You can check the constructed tree in `DT.pdf`.

## KNN

In `knn.py`, the KNN algorithm is implemented in order to predict whether a mushroom is ‫‪poisonous‬‬ or not from its other attributes. <br>
The data set is available in `Dataset/Dataset2.csv`.

## Naive bayes

In `naive_bayes.py`, a naive Bayes classifier is implemented in order to predict whether a person has a disease‬ or not from their other attributes. <br>
The data set is available in `Dataset/Dataset3.csv`.
